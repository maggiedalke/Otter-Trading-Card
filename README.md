# Animal Trading Card
**Hosted:** otter-trading-card.netlify.app/

This is an styling repo I made to create a trading card for my favorite animal an **Otter**. <br> 
It is the first project I made in CSS, and I had a great time making it and exploring my creative side. 

## Development Process
I did some reasearch on Otters so I could fill in information on the card about them. 
Then using 2 different styles from Google Fonts I applied them to the card.

Once I added an image of the otter and information, I applied the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the appearance of a trading card.<br>
**It is important to link to your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.**

I then gave my otter a name *'Noodles*' and overlayed the text(using the 2nd Google Font) on the image with appropriate placement. 

**The CSS applied these styles:**
~~~~
Background color for the entire card
Contrasting color for the borders
italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
use an UL for the animals list items, but do not display dots on them
border around the animal's name, image, and information
border around the animal's information
spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
Your card is centered in the page, not just off to the left.
~~~~
