# Animal Trading Card

Using your knowledge of HTML create the structure for your trading card. <br>
Then you will use CSS styling to design your trading card. 

Be sure to include an image of your animal, I suggest a rectangular image since it usually ends up looking better. <br>
You will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.

Next, you'll want to do just a little bit of research so you can fill in information on the card about your favorite animal. <br>
All the text on the card should be in 1 of the 2 custom fonts I would like you to use. You can pick any font you like at Google Fonts.

Once you've added your favorite animal image and information, add the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the project mockup by applying the necessary style rules.<br>
**Be sure to link to your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.**

Finally, be sure to give your animal a name. Overlay that name on the image in one of the corners. <br>
You should use a second custom font just for this name.

**The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:**
~~~~
Background color for the entire card
Contrasting color for the borders
italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
use an UL for the animals list items, but do not display dots on them
border around the animal's name, image, and information
border around the animal's information
spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
Your card is centered in the page, not just off to the left.
